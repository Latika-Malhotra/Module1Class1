            Water is an <em>inorganic</em> <i>compound</i> with the <strong>chemical</strong> formula <b>H<sub>2</sub>O</b>. It is a transparent, tasteless, odorless,[c] and nearly colorless chemical substance. It is the main constituent of Earth's hydrosphere and the fluids of all known living organisms (in which it acts as a solvent[19]). It is vital for all known forms of life, despite not providing food energy or organic micronutrients. Its chemical formula, H2O, indicates that each of its molecules contains one oxygen and two hydrogen atoms, connected by covalent bonds. The hydrogen atoms are attached to the oxygen atom at an angle of 104.45Â°.[20] In liquid form, H2O is also called "water" at standard temperature and pressure.

            Because <mark>Earth's</mark> environment is relatively <small>close</small> to water's triple <del>point</del>, water exists on Earth as a solid, a liquid, and a gas.[21] It forms precipitation in the form of <q>rain and aerosols in the form</q> of fog. Clouds consist of suspended droplets of water and ice, its solid state. When finely divided, crystalline ice may precipitate in the form of snow. The gaseous state of water is steam or water vapor.
